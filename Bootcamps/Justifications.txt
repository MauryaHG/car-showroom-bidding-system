integer:-
        advantages
            easier to use
        disadvantages
            complications as arraylist is used
String:-
        advantages
            easier to use with arraylist methods as buyer name is also in string
        disadvantages

I have chose to use buyerId as type string as this would make it easier to handle with ArrayList methods

givenName and familyName because people can have more than 2 names or people can have different order of firstName and lastName

Task-7
Iterate through the buyer array list, while checking current buyerid with all previous buyerid s that you have already gone over  to see if it is a duplicate
if it is do not print else print it
